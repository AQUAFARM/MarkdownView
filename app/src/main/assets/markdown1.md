# Emphasis

To create **bold** or *italic*, wrap with asterisks * or underscores _.

To avoid creating __bold__ or _italic_, place a backslash in front \\* or \\_.

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

# Paragraphs

A paragraph is consecutive lines of text with one or more blank lines between them.

For a line break, add either a backslash \ or two blank spaces at the end of the line.

This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.

This is a\
line break.

# Headings

Starting a line with a hash # and a space makes a header.

The more #, the smaller the header.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

# Links

Links can be either inline with the text, or placed at the bottom of the text as references.

Link text is enclosed by square brackets [], and for inline links, the link URL is enclosed by parens ().

[Google](https://www.google.com)

# Images
Images are almost identical to links, but an image starts with an exclamation point !.

# Code
To create inline code, wrap with backticks `.

To create a code block, either indent each line by 4 spaces, or place 3 backticks ``` on a line above and below the code block.

Inline `code`

    indent 4 spaces

```
Or use 3 backticks
```

# Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, start a line with greater than > followed by an optional space.

Blockquotes can be nested, and can also contain other formatting.

> First line
> Another line
>
> > Nested line
>
> Last line

# Lists
Unordered lists can use either asterisks *, plus +, or hyphens - as list markers.
Ordered lists use numbers followed by period . or right paren ).

* Apples
* Oranges
* Pears

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

# Nested Lists
To nest one list within another, indent each item in the sublist by four spaces. You can also nest other elements like paragraphs, blockquotes or code blocks.

* Item
    1. First Subitem
    2. Second Subitem
* Item
    - Subitem
    - Subitem
* Item
